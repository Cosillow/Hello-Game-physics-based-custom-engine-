# Hello-Game
  Connor's first C++ game

## setup
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
  ./buildRun.sh

## TODO
* look at hitbox, make it not update every time?


## game ideas
* I want only keyboard controls if possible, aiming with mouse is annoying, and its easier to play on a laptop, which should be possible, not intensive
* could have an aim circle that you can switch rotating left and right on player axis
*
