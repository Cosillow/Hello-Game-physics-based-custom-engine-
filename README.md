# Hello-Game
  Connor's first C++ game

## setup
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
  ./buildRun.sh

## TODO
* GUI library with https://github.com/mobius3/KiWi
* make private methods for startMove(bool right) and stopMove(left)
  ^^ do this so you can clean up the guard for max speed repeating code
