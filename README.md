# Hello-Game
  Connor's first C++ game

## setup
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
  ./buildRun.sh

## TODO
* look at hitbox, make it not update every time?
* make oldposition and newposition protected
  * api following that
* add imgui for velocity, acceleration, position
* figure out edges of platforms
* DebugMenu class
  * abstract away imgui


## game ideas
* I want only keyboard controls if possible, aiming with mouse is annoying, and its easier to play on a laptop, which should be possible, not intensive
* could have an aim circle that you can switch rotating left and right on player axis
*
